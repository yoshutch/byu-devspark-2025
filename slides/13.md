## Code Example 3 (Kotlin - inline conditional)
```kotlin
if ((customer.isVip || order.totalCents >= 10_000 || coupon?.freeShipping == true) &&
    !address.isInternational &&
    (now.dayOfWeek !in setOf(DayOfWeek.SATURDAY, DayOfWeek.SUNDAY) || warehouse.supportsWeekendOps) &&
    !(weather.isSevere && carrier == Carrier.USPS)
) {
    upgradeToExpress(order)
}
```
**Why is this complex:**
* Difficult to understand what actually allows the user to `upgradeToExpress`
* Difficult to debug/log/test individual scenarios
* Risky to change

### Simplified

```kotlin
val isVip                   = customer.isVip 
val hasQualifiedSpendAmount = order.totalCents >= 10_000
val hasFreeShipCoupon       = coupon?.freeShipping == true
val domesticAddress         = !address.isInternational
val canPickThisWeekend      = warehouse.supportsWeekendOps
val isWeekend               = now.dayOfWeek in setOf(DayOfWeek.SATURDAY, DayOfWeek.SUNDAY)
val weekendOk               = !isWeekend || canPickThisWeekend
val carrierSafe             = !(weather.isSevere && carrier == Carrier.USPS)  // avoid unsafe combo

val qualifiesForExpress = (isVip || hasQualifiedSpendAmount || hasFreeShipCoupon) &&
        domesticAddress &&
        weekendOk &&
        carrierSafe

if (qualifiesForExpress) upgradeToExpress(order)
```
**Why is this simple:**
* Simpler to understand what allows the user to `upgradeToExpress`
* Easier to debug/log/test
* Fewer mental negations (double negatives are harder to read)
* Safer to change
