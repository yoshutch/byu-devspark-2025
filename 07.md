## Architecture Example

BYU OIT maintains the software that runs what we call the "Payment Manager" system.

A few years ago my team was tasked with rewriting the system in Node.js and deploying it to AWS.

We decided to start from scratch and build the application as a "cloud-native" application.
We even had an architectural decision record (ADR) that I (regrettably) approved.

We thought at the time that going "cloud native" would be easy because it would be:
* less custom code, because we'd use cloud tools instead
* simpler infrastructure and platform management, because of Terraform
* more event-driven and asynchronous, because Event-Driven Architecture made sense as a superior and resilient application architecture pattern
