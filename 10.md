## Architecture Example

**Our team realized that we couldn't maintain this architecture with our limited resources.**

### So we simplified!
#### From

#### To
![payment_manager_simplified.png](/img/payment_manager_simplified.png)

#### Major simplification differences:
1. Single docker image for the Fargate server and all scheduled tasks
2. Consolidated most DynamoDB tables into the Postgres RDS database
3. Removed SQS queues
4. Consolidated some Lambda tasks into the server and fewer scheduled Fargate tasks
