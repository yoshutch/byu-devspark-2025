## Architecture Example

After several months of design and implementation, we had a testable working application.

![payment_manager_cloud_native_architecture.png](/img/payment_manager_cloud_native_architecture.png)

It had all the bells and whistles:
* SQS Queues that would trigger emails
* CloudWatch timers that would trigger internal Lambda batch processes
* No-SQL DynamoDB database tables that managed all the transactional data
* The database tables would trigger other internal Lambda processes that would update internal data or send events or query external APIs etc.
* S3 bucket to manage specific file imports that triggered other internal Lambda processes
* And a Fargate Service that acted as the main REST API backend server
