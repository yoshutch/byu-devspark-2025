## About Me
* I’m an IT Architect at BYU OIT, following twelve years as a software developer.
* I hold a Master of Information Systems Management (MISM) degree from BYU.
* Kotlin is my favorite language, Go is a close second.
* Outside of work you’ll find me playing board and video games, visiting Disneyland, or reading Brandon Sanderson novels.
